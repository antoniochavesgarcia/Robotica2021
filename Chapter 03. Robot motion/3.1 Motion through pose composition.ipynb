    "# 3.1 Motion through pose composition\n",
    "\n",
    "A fundamental aspect of the development of mobile robots is the motion itself. This is not a trivial matter, as many sources of motion error appear: \n",
    "- wheel slippage, \n",
    "- inaccurate calibration,\n",
    "- limited resolution during integration (time increments, measurement resolution), or\n",
    "- unequal floor, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "These factors introduce uncertainty in the robot motion. Additionally, other constraints to the movement difficult its implementation. This particular chapter explores the concept of *robot's pose* and how we deal with it in a probabilistic context.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pose itself can take multiple forms depending on the problem context:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **2D location**: In a planar context we only need to a 2d vector $[x, y]^T$ to locate a robot against a point of reference, the origin $(0, 0).$\n",
    "- **2D pose**: In most cases involving mobile robots, the location alone is insufficient. We need an additional parameter known as orientation or *bearing*. Therefore, a robot's pose is usually expressed as $[x, y, \\theta]^T$ (see Fig. 1). *In the rest of the book, we mostly refer to this one.*\n",
    "- **3D pose**: Although we will only mention it in passing, for robotics applications in the 3D space, *i.e.* UAV or drones, not only a third axis $z$ is added, but to handle the orientation in a 3D environment we need 3 components, *i.e.* roll, pitch and yaw. This course is centered around planar mobile robots so we will not use this one, nevertheless most methods could be adapted to 3D environments.\n",
